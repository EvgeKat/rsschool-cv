## About Me
I work as an economist. But I decided to master a new profession and my choice was a JS developer. In my opinion, this is a good job that requires constant development and learning new things.

## Skills
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript (Basic)
 * React JS (Basic)

## Code examples

import React from 'react';
import style from './Item.module.css';

const Title = (props) => {
    const { TitleText } = props;

    return (
      <h1 className={style.conteiner}>
       {TitleText}
      </h1>
    );
}

export default Title;

## Experience
I have no work experience, so I just enter this specialty. There is a practice experience, which consists in creating sites according to the sample, but with rewriting the code.

## Education
There is no specialized education. I watched HTMl academy courses, React JS lessons, with the creation of a site based on a sample. Now I started studying at the RS-school.

## Language
I speak English at an elementary level, I can read and translate. I understand a little and speak English.
